The upecman is a project developed during my first academic year. It is made using the the [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html) GNU library and many C language resources.

The goal here was to replicate the classic Pacman game in a terminal enviroment including all the caracteristics of the original game such as ghost's individual movement patterns, pacman and ghost's speed affected by level, cherry spawn, lives, points and all that could be applied to accomplish the goal.

You can check the detailed project here or download its files on github.

<h3 id="ttt">Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<h3 id="sudoku">Sudoku Solver</h3>

The sudoku-solver is a program developed to automatically solve a sudoku challenge given as input file.

The program uses various known methods of sudoku resolution using C language to represent them and combine these to provide precise results as the dificult of the input challenges increases. Each method is responsible for the calculation of some specific situation of numbers and through them, excludes possible candidates of determined positions. The combination of these methods results in a faster, lighter and flawless output of the result.

You can view all methods and codes related to this program here or download the whole project on github.

<h3 id="numberR">Number Reading</h3>

<h2 id="py">Python</h2>
<h3 id="hybridS">Hybrid System</h3>
<h3 id="arc">Arcadia</h3>

Arcadia is a software designed to simulate [Google Stadia](https://stadia.google.com) gaming stream service and create a user registration system using a local database.

This project is made on Python 3 and uses many python libraries in order to create a functional system. This was firstly requested as a academic project to get familiarized with python features and later improved to get a cleaner and optimized result. Despite it being a simple software it fully accomplishes its main goal to create, edit and maintain a userbase and all attributes attained to each of then such as: Subscrition status, email, name, age etc.
