The upecman is a project developed during my first academic year. It is made using the the [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html) GNU library and many C language resources.

The goal here was to replicate the classic Pacman game in a terminal enviroment including all the caracteristics of the original game that could be applied to this objective.

You can check the detailed project here or download its files on github.
